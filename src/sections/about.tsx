        Hello! Iâ€™m Matt Harvey Ostulano, pursuing a career in UI/UX and Web
        design. My passion for creating engaging PowerPoint presentations in
        high school introduced me to design principles like animations,
        transitions, and readability, which led me to UI/UX. I aim to create
        user-friendly, visually appealing designs for mobile apps and websites,
        showcasing my skills through personal projects.
